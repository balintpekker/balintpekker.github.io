Beginning your Drupal journey can feel like navigating uncharted\nterritory, leaving many feeling frustrated before they even begin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-problem\">The Problem</h3>\n<p>It often starts with the tutorials provided on Drupal.org. While these aim to\nguide beginners through the process of setting up and using Drupal, they often fall short\nof delivering a smooth experience. There are outdated instructions, conflicting\ninformation, and a lack of an actual, recommended step-by-step guidance that one could\nfollow.</p>\n<p>For instance, the following guides each seem to have their own issues, in my opinion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/getting-started/installing-drupal\">Installing Drupal</a> -\nWhile the first chapter advises using one of the recommended <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup/docker-based-development-environments-for-macos-linux-and-windows\">Docker-based solutions</a>,\nit only offers links to various quickstart guides without providing clear, concise\ninstructions. As a result, users are left to navigate multiple sites in search of the\nnecessary information, making it difficult to gather just the prerequisites. Installing\nDrupal should not be that hard, and the process should be more straightforward.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html\">Drupal User Guide</a> - While the\nguide offers a thorough explanation of Drupal site building, it lacks the interactive\nexperience of navigating through an actual Drupal site. As a result, it primarily serves\nas a valuable resource once you already have Drupal installed. Without that, reading\nthrough the documentation may not provide the full understanding of its functionality.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs\">Docs</a> - The documentation includes references to\nmultiple guides, such as the 'Installing Drupal' guide mentioned earlier, which we've\nidentified as lacking clarity. The guides listed here span various levels of expertise\ncovering topics from site building to development tasks. The structure may not\nbe well-suited for beginners, as it lacks clear progression for someone who is just\nstarting out.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course, you could opt for the one-liner from the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/download\">download page</a> to create the Umami\ndemo site, but if your goal is to truly understand Drupal, taking the shortcut might\nleave you feeling like you missed the whole show, not to mention you need PHP and Composer for it to work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For someone with no prior knowledge of the platform, <strong>choosing which guide to follow\ncan be challenging</strong>, and make this seemingly simple task feel daunting. Also,\ninvesting time in a process that should be as simple as making toast might leave\nyou questioning if you accidentally signed up for a crash course in rocket science\ninstead!</p>\n<h3 id=\"possible-solution-concept-and-proposal\">Possible Solution: Concept and Proposal</h3>\n<p>What's essential is a beginner-friendly, comprehensive guide — <strong>a single source of truth</strong>\n— that provides clear, step-by-step instructions for installing Drupal on your computer,\nfrom start to finish. However, it's not just about having the right instructions. It's also about providing\nnewcomers with the tools they need to succeed. This is where the Drupal community can\nstep in and make a real difference.</p>\n<p>Lately, some experienced developers are taking their knowledge for granted. It's all\ntoo easy to forget the challenges we faced when we were first starting out with Drupal\nand to overlook the struggles of newcomers.</p>\n<p>For example, how can you expect your sales team to effectively promote Drupal over other CMS solutions\nif they lack insight into Drupal's capabilities? Moreover, how can you address the\ninconvenience of developers needing to attend sales meetings to provide answers for\nstakeholders? While one solution might involve providing the user guide to your sales team\nand encouraging them to read it, the reality is that they may not prioritize doing so.\nEven if they do, they won't gain the same level of expertise as someone who actively\nnavigates through Drupal, exploring the connections between custom content types and\nviews firsthand. <strong>Sales representatives could more effectively sell products they\nunderstand.</strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"the-structure-of-the-ssot\">The structure of the SSOT</h4>\n<p>First, we need <strong>audience identification</strong>, to provide clear sections for both newcomers\nand developers, guiding them through the process of getting started or delving deeper\ninto development aspects.</p>\n<p>Once we identified the target audience (and we are targeting the newcomers in this post,\ntherefore we are not describing the other parts), we can create the most easy, step-by-step\nguide by providing tools and commands to install drupal on a local computer.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/570714802647ddb7e2673bcb6fa3bbf4/9f21b/concept_for_documentation.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 115.82278481012658%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAXCAYAAAALHW+jAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAES0lEQVR42o2Ve0ybVRTAD4zHSkEe2pYKYzCeLXMRYUZJSH0Edf+MEEOii0sMfxlD4h8G1MVAQpiTuMUEBqxlw9nylVLo+wWFPiyFlXY6la1gN5VkCkXExNcfrh3Xc8tnaIKs+5Jfzunt+c6959xzzgcAUIE8hRxDihERchQRI/VIDatTGw4kfAoL84DHyweBgB/T8/N5wOcLYpKuUT07OwctD8DDPEKAjELcmUoBAJfqVPIAMukamnCRg/CwD3fAegwGZo7DoLM2pd9eR4FLrjqI6a46ztDs09nnmFzWPCmhwxxl4K+KqTvRSksoUmb+LlJlDUXKUaeSb1j5B7S3CUfqfDtmrCaJwxYYV0jNwiZ5Yi5MRJ4wqUaq3OukDMmc/ikKji2SIV/oiBl3uVISOuSrvgwdtYU2Kg23NsXm4EapcfnXg+qljVT1zTVgvv0ZVEu/pV60n945oTrxCdPPKhvhnfOvQ2vnaehWnxR0DT/3Vv/lk22D8pbW7t7W964om8/0XCigtuKWlrSysrJ0+to+pIHQuLJd6w2TWvfdbfHCFnlW47/uc85EHC4XsdvtUb/fT7Rawwdo/LhWq13V6XRbExMTYZPJFHY6neuzs7PrDodj3ev1/jI5ObkBj454Pi0Znb9Uctl+lcdcGxIPGdosGvU5rV5/Vq/Xd5rN5v6enp5mdMhDh/PID2NjY98zDLOKcnV8fPxH5A7ahpRK5Y3/Ik+jF65obhDK2tsaWl5744WOjo5n+vr6qqRSaSoNRyQS1Wg0mnW1Wk3w5ejU1NS2zWYjVquVcn9mZoag4z8ACElufPeTWPHqjGap0+0mFoslQo0wJIKnOEF3bGpqOoTOpvF3AFnAsL0Yvhude/DUXoxkAf93UYdJ9a3tWbRPzdPTI07MHRpGkKjH4yEGg+GVuDt8BDmCFCGlyGNI5p6Cl0gkdBEcNmt/wL9IjCZTFMO5v7i4SDBXL9P/CG6MIpsdHiWszt3jLPe87lDqGdmTcOr92hPDmsYLctWrihFZg0KheFGlUj3f29ubFWeezPZ16r51mKHwbwiwxQp0t/7O1Qa3k2Tebtg5UnKCEv7/vj5sWL4n8a5t13vuRo4Hfic5jE9K0PiwRJJTWVmZxeaIE+fkwQOCqwne4zvDpNS1Fs2e/5Nw5b5hTIwAMvNE7PClspzujdCO4T9wNqZ/NPESfCh/E9oHW+HjyVPQMSDaGQRdyWzOkliZEsf+6RAwi8EqUzBYrlv6ptq8Eqi2LC+Jbbc3c+U+F2034HAKduZwjHzaMWz50FvO2uM8b+QLWeFYQCH8zKMqUl2/Wqz0jVSpA4q8YXdn7EaFQjq140mPy+XefAo/9148MjqnKJLataXMNaZYMTd64Mo8kzLs6eTtXkgGWy4Z7CVxYffzwGXXdj4TfMZnLTcGp8r1N00V2q/NxRNfmdPHbrjT5D6ZcNcRJ25EcfYZXbHa/BcbXeVne/g+uAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"concept_for_documentation.png\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/570714802647ddb7e2673bcb6fa3bbf4/f058b/concept_for_documentation.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/570714802647ddb7e2673bcb6fa3bbf4/c26ae/concept_for_documentation.png 158w,\n/static/570714802647ddb7e2673bcb6fa3bbf4/6bdcf/concept_for_documentation.png 315w,\n/static/570714802647ddb7e2673bcb6fa3bbf4/f058b/concept_for_documentation.png 630w,\n/static/570714802647ddb7e2673bcb6fa3bbf4/9f21b/concept_for_documentation.png 706w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>As one can see, there are already some recommendations present in both the current\ndocumentation on Drupal.org's docker-based tutorial and the proposed concept above.\nHowever, this presents a challenge as it lacks a straightforward solution, leaving\nthe task of deciding between options like Lando or DDEV, which can be overwhelming\nwithout prior experience.
