I think Recipes are great for providing developers with a starting point.

I think Recipes serve as an excellent starting point for developers. My blog is featured on Drupal Planet, and as of now I only use X and Mastodon. I'm definitely going to check out ActivityPub, thanks for the info!

My take on the Future of #Drupal. Would love to hear thoughts and opinions too on the subject!


My small take on the Future of #Drupal. Would love to hear your thoughts!


Say goodbye to updating #drupal manually and stay up-to-date with just a click! Huge appreciation for the incredible team behind this initiative.

I completely agree with most of the points you've made in your post. It's definitely a cleaner approach to "Just say Drupal" in terms of marketing.

However, transitioning away from mentioning version numbers might be a challenge within the developer community. Given that Automatic Updates may not be enabled on every site as a mandatory feature, abandoning this practice might not be as straightforward as it seems.

Overall, I found your post to be quite insightful and thought-provoking. Thank you for sharing your perspective on this matter — I truly enjoyed reading it.
